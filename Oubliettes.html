											<h2>Oubliettes</h2>
											<p>Great Harvest Game Jam</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											This month-long game jam proved to be my biggest independent project yet. I wanted to submit this for the 
											game jam as well as my final project for the HarvardX Game Development Professional Certificate. The theme 
											of the jam was the season of fall in November and to follow as strict color palette called pear-36. This color
											palette makes it so the atmosphere is cozy and gives the feeling of leaves falling from a tree or setting a 
											table for Thanksgiving. So with this in mind, I decided to create a pet project.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Inspiration</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Oubliettes was to be a game about the near endless posibilities of procedurally designed missions accessed from 
											a job board in a cozy bar the player finds himself in. I wanted to create this sense of a hub with multiple things 
											to do right from the start. This tested the limits of my abilities at the time as well as my ability to crunch down 
											the scope of a game to a time constraint.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>How its made</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											 The game uses a Universal Render Pipeline though it is strictly cast onto 2D so I could play around with shaders for 
											 the first time. There are separate scenes for each mission that call a construction function upon generation that randomly selects
											 the size, map layout, number and type of enemies, and goals to achieve in order to return to the bar. There is also a primitive inventory and 
											 equipment system in place so the player can keep items on themselves throughout missions. These missions take in a varying amount 
											 of values to determine how it will be but all mainly take in deciding values from the name of the mission the player selects 
											 from the job board. I chose this layout mainly to play around with a structure such as this one.
										</p>
										<p>
											I applied a neat little UI system that updates itself in real-time based on the player's health and inventory, as well as available actions. 
											I made it so the player would have varying actions pop up when within the radius of trigger colliders and to have the matching action appear 
											on the UI if the player is closest to the center point of a collider. This was to override the possibility of being unable to interact with 
											an object if it is surrounded by others. There is a primitive combat system in place but it limited to use in missions or combat zones only. 
											To test it out I created a back room in the hub where the player can fight in different scenarios. Unfortunately, I did not have the time necessary 
											to refine the system, and now enemies just run to the characters location when within range and immediately start whacking non-stop, until the player 
											is dead. This only stops if the player is able to get out of the enemy's aggro range or if the player kills the enemy. I wanted to make the enemy 
											smarter and strafe around the player to add more diverse gameplay or richer combat, but I couldn't figure it out in time and it wasn't the 
											main goal of this project.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The version currently up on itch is a very rough prototype that offers only some of the options available from the bar hub. 
											The more recent version that holds many more features was submitted as the final project and will be optimized in due time for 
											resubmission on itch to make it available to everyone. Eventually I will retry making this concept in 3D and improve the ideas 
											mentioned to create a fully fleshed out game. As a learning experience, this was by far the most fruitful on in my game 
											development journey as I had never faced this many challenges in a project beforehand.
