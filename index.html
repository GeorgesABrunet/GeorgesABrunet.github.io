          <h3>
            Hello there!
          </h3>
<p>
My name is Georges Brunet and I’m an aspiring Data Scientist based in Niwot, Colorado. I love being able to tell a story with the help of numbers and so Data Science is the perfect intersection of creativity and mathematics. While I do enjoy working alone, I feel that the best insights are gathered through collaboration and that is why I love to work with people on Data Science projects. 
<br>
<br>
I am a French native but I have lived and studied in different parts of the world. I moved away from France in 2003 and since then I have lived or studied in Carmel (Indiana), Millburn (New Jersey), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Marbella (Spain), and Boulder (Colorado). I am currently living in Niwot, Colorado. I enjoy comedy and love the company of my friends and family. In my free time I like to make art, whether it be sculptures or paintings, watch sports, or my personal favorite: play video games.
<br>
<br>
I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder’s School of Arts & Sciences with a B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in Applicability and Statistics in August 2019. Throughout my years at the university I worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Aspen Growth Ventures, a French Tutor at the French and Italian Department of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and as a Data Science Intern at Standard Alcohol, Inc.
