    Hello there!
  </h3>
  <p class="main">
      My name is Georges Brunet and I’m an aspiring Data Scientist based in Niwot, Colorado. I love being able to tell a story with the help of numbers and so Data Science is the perfect intersection of creativity and mathematics. While I do enjoy working alone, I feel that the best insights are gathered through collaboration and that is why I love to work with people on Data Science projects. 
    <br>
    <br>
      I am a French native but I have lived and studied in different parts of the world. I moved away from France in 2003 and since then I have lived or studied in Carmel (Indiana), Millburn (New Jersey), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Marbella (Spain), and Boulder (Colorado). I am currently living in Niwot, Colorado. I enjoy comedy and love the company of my friends and family. In my free time I like to make art, whether it be sculptures or paintings, watch sports, or my personal favorite: play video games.
    <br>
    <br>
      I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder’s School of Arts & Sciences with a B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in Applicability and Statistics in August 2019. Throughout my years at the university I worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Aspen Growth Ventures, a French Tutor at the French and Italian Department of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and as a Data Science Intern at Standard Alcohol, Inc.

              <p>
                From June 2018 to June 2019, I had the pleasure of working as a Data Science Intern at OctaneX Technologies, formerly known as Standard Alcohol at the time. I had numerous roles throughout my year there that each provided me with valuable experience and knowledge in a truly interesting industry.

            <h3> Department of French and Italian <br> French Tutor </h3>
            <p>As a French Tutor at the university, I developed and implemented comprehensive lesson plans for students of lower and higher division levels.
              <br>
              <br>
              From September 2016 to March 2018, I worked as a tutor at the Department of French and Italian at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I provided services to students of all levels, ranging from beginner levels to Master’s levels. As a French native who learned a few other languages growing up, I have a good sense of what commonalities in certain languages pose problems to speakers of languages with different grammatical structures. This motivated me to design level assessments for my students to measure their capabilities in French by topics and pinpoint the areas of improvement that aligned with the areas they wanted to improve. I also provided revisions to students’ papers and assisted them in developing their own voice in French in the form of writing.
