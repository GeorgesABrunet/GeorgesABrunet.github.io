    Hello there!
  </h3>
  <p class="main">
      My name is Georges Brunet and I’m an aspiring Data Scientist based in Niwot, Colorado. I love being able to tell a story with the help of numbers and so Data Science is the perfect intersection of creativity and mathematics. While I do enjoy working alone, I feel that the best insights are gathered through collaboration and that is why I love to work with people on Data Science projects. 
    <br>
    <br>
      I am a French native but I have lived and studied in different parts of the world. I moved away from France in 2003 and since then I have lived or studied in Carmel (Indiana), Millburn (New Jersey), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Cambridge (United Kingdom), Marbella (Spain), and Boulder (Colorado). I am currently living in Niwot, Colorado. I enjoy comedy and love the company of my friends and family. In my free time I like to make art, whether it be sculptures or paintings, watch sports, or my personal favorite: play video games.
    <br>
    <br>
      I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder’s School of Arts & Sciences with a B.A. in Mathematics with a concentration in Applicability and Statistics in August 2019. Throughout my years at the university I worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Aspen Growth Ventures, a French Tutor at the French and Italian Department of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and as a Data Science Intern at Standard Alcohol, Inc.

            <h3> Department of French and Italian <br> French Tutor </h3>
            <p>As a French Tutor at the university, I developed and implemented comprehensive lesson plans for students of lower and higher division levels.
              <br>
              <br>
              From September 2016 to March 2018, I worked as a tutor at the Department of French and Italian at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I provided services to students of all levels, ranging from beginner levels to Master’s levels. As a French native who learned a few other languages growing up, I have a good sense of what commonalities in certain languages pose problems to speakers of languages with different grammatical structures. This motivated me to design level assessments for my students to measure their capabilities in French by topics and pinpoint the areas of improvement that aligned with the areas they wanted to improve. I also provided revisions to students’ papers and assisted them in developing their own voice in French in the form of writing.

                  The Data Science Professional Certificate was provided by IBM through Coursera. This certificate provided platforms such as Jupyter Notebooks, Cognitive AI, and more to complete rigorous data analytics and data science assignments. These assignments were mainly former business projects of IBM while other assignments provided deep explorations on the forefront of tools used to perform data science. The last assignment for this certificate was a purely self-conceptualized data science project in which we were to find a problem or interesting set of data, explore it, analyze it, visualize it, and conclude an appropriate developed answer or discover a deeper meaning to it. These conclusions could range from financial insights to simply improvements in quality of life.

                 <h3> The Problem</h3>

                <p>
                  I chose to find a mixture of both. I decided my capstone project would be to determine what the most popular type of cuisine is in Denver, Colorado per borough or neighborhood and determine which ones would be good candidates to open up a new restaurant of such cuisine. 
                </p>

                 <h3> The Structure </h3>
                <p>
                 I decided to build this project on a Jupyter Notebook using Python as the main language to code, utilizing various Python packages to create the dataframes and perform statistical analysis and visualization. 
                </p>

                 <h3> Data Sources & Cleaning </h3>
                <p>
                  To determine the range of the neighborhoods I would be analyzing, I decided to retrieve a csv file containing all the official names of the recognized neighborhoods of Denver on the city of Denver’s official website. This file would constitute a list of 78 names to which I attributed central geographical coordinates using Google’s API.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  To determine the venues in those neighborhoods, I used FourSquare’s API to identify every marked venue within a 1200 meter radius to the center of each neighborhood and appended them to a dataframe. I applied  various filters to remove duplicates and remove venues that were not restaurants. After restructuring, I had over 1000 restaurants in Denver and over 40 different types of cuisine.
                </p>

                 <h3> Data Features </h3>
                <p>
                 After applying the various filters mentioned above, I had two dataframes with which I could work. One dataframe was specifically focused on the neighborhoods and their distinguishable features (columns), that is to say the neighborhood ID, name, the neighborhood’s center’s latitude, longitude, the number of restaurants in that neighborhood, and the number of types of cuisines in that neighborhood. With 6 columns and 78 rows, this dataframe was mainly used to perform exploratory data analysis to generate visualizations and insights on distribution.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                The second dataframe was the one generated from the venues found by the FourSquare API and then filtered. This dataframe held all the data on restaurants. Its data features were the restaurant’s name, type of cuisine, latitude, longitude, and the name, latitude, and longitude of the neighborhood to which it belonged. With 7 columns and over 1000 rows, this dataframe provided the raw information to be used in the first dataframe.

                </p>

                <h3> The Type of Cuisine to Pick </h3>
                <p>
                Determining which cuisine was the most popular depended on multiple factors. For one, the distribution of restaurants varied from neighborhood to neighborhood, as one would expect. Some boroughs had more diversified cuisine and some had more restaurants, but significantly less diversity. The deciding factor was which cuisine had the greatest presence, or in other words, which cuisine had the most restaurants in Denver. The calculations showed that Mexican cuisine was the most prominent type, with 189 restaurants in Denver, with pizza places and American restaurants in close second and third, with 163 and 162, respectively. All cuisine types that represented less than 1% of the distribution were to be appended to the “Other” type to simplify visualizations. As you can see below, this pie chart represents the distribution of restaurant types in Denver as determined by my project.

                <h3> What Makes a Good Spot for a New Restaurant </h3>
                <p>
                 From the information gathered through creating a pie chart, I decided to count how many Mexican restaurants there were per neighborhood. This would later be used to calculate the frequency of such restaurants among neighborhoods, but integer values would give insight as to whether a neighborhood already has a significant number of Mexican restaurants. I created a double horizontal bar chart displaying the number of Mexican restaurants per neighborhood in comparison to other restaurants per neighborhood which demonstrated quite a few things to be considered. It showed that of all 78 neighborhoods, 12 did not contain any Mexican restaurants. Of those 12, only 3 had more than 10 restaurants. The earlier bar chart showed the same three had significant diversity in relation to their number of restaurants. This immediately led me to know they would be candidate neighborhoods at the end, but I would need to determine more from the other neighborhoods as 3 candidate neighborhoods are insufficient. There must be a generally low distribution of already existing Mexican restaurants in a neighborhood for the potential to place a new one to be viable. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
               The next step here was to use one hot encoding on the second dataframe to determine the frequency values of each type of restaurant per neighborhood. Using assistance from a previous lab in the course and the layout of the code as a template, I created a dataframe to display this and then displayed a table of the top 5 frequencies of restaurant types per neighborhood. This led to determining the most common type of restaurant per neighborhood in descriptive terms instead of numerical values. I displayed a value_counts table of this information. This table suggested that even though Mexican restaurants were the most numerous around Denver, American restaurants and Pizza places outnumbered them in commonality in neighborhoods. This suggested that distribution of American restaurants and pizza places were denser in some neighborhoods than others and that Mexican restaurants were more evenly spread. I appended the ‘1st Most Common Restaurant” column to the main dataframe, and it supplied me with enough information to determine which neighborhoods would be the best candidates.
               <br>
               <br>
                The main dataframe to be used to determine the candidate neighborhoods would have 9 descriptive columns: Neighborhood ID, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, number of Mexican restaurants, number of restaurants, number of categories, 1st most common restaurant, and the frequency value of Mexican restaurants. Using these defining features, I would apply constraints as mentioned earlier to determine the proper candidate neighborhoods. I would base a candidate neighborhood if the number of restaurants per neighborhood is greater than 10, if the most common restaurant type is not Mexican, and if the Mexican restaurant frequency in the neighborhood is less than 0.125. I applied these measures and appended the remaining dataframe to a folium map.


                </p>

                <h3> Results </h3>
                <p>
                 Applying the calculations above returned 17 candidate neighborhoods. Of the 17, 10 had 20 or more restaurants in the area, suggesting they are viable in competition. All neighborhoods displayed 8 or more restaurant categories, suggesting room for additional diversity and 12 of the 17 neighborhoods had 2 or less Mexican restaurants. Only 3 of the neighborhoods had 0 Mexican restaurants. The 17 neighborhoods are: Auraria, Cherry Creek, Congress Park, City Park, Highland, Rosedale, University Park, Mar Lee, Civic Center, CBD, Stapleton, Montbello, Lowry Field, Skyland, Platt Park, Hampden, and Bear Valley. It is important to note that these were calculated with the limitations of FourSquare’s ability to detect venues in general and the limitations of my coding abilities. The reality may differ slightly from the values suggested. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
               Our analysis shows us that there are 17 neighborhoods in Denver that satisfy all statistical conditions to be optimal places to open up a new Mexican restaurant. These decisions were made by calculations based on a filter of 1200 meters from the center of each neighborhood that captured 4600+ venues at first, which we slimmed down to around 1000+ restaurants. Choosing the data features for the Venue Categories were vital to the analysis as it provided us with the range of possible restaurants to use in this project. As we can see from the map, the neighborhoods of focus are for the main part concentrated near the business center of Denver, Capitol Hill. This is great news as this is the busiest area of Denver, where socio-economic dynamics are optimal, and the wide range of diversity in the area makes it so a new restaurant would fit right in.

                 <h3> Discussion 
 </h3>
                <p>
                 I decided not to specify addresses and pinpointing potential locations within the neighborhoods as my capabilities are limited in those aspects and I wouldn't be able to decipher what is a realistic potential address from what could be in the middle of a building. I decided to leave that information for interpretation of the reader, who if interested would be keen to figure out a desirable spot within that neighborhood. 

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 I also chose to remove neighborhoods with less than 10 restaurants from the final dataframe as there are many reasons for a neighborhood to have little food venues. Those could be based on the structure of the neighborhood (if it is mainly residential, for example) or there could be important underlying reasons for the lack of food attractions. Anyways, I felt they would not be significant for analysis due to the many complications small numbers bring in making decisions on opening a new business. 


                </p>

                 <h3> Conclusions </h3>
                <p>
                The purpose of this project was to identify which neighborhoods could be viable candidates to open a new restaurant of a certain type. This type of restaurant would be based on popularity, which was determined by the total number of those restaurants in Denver. The neighborhoods were to be picked based on their lack of the most popular type of restaurant, the number of other restaurants in the area which would suggest if or if not the neighborhood is busy enough to be viable, and whether the neighborhood had already existing restaurants of that type or not. Fast Food restaurants were removed from analysis since they can pretty much be placed around a city like darts thrown randomly at a target. This information in all would aid stakeholders or aspiring restaurant business owners in Denver to open up a restaurant with a promised audience in a busy area, yet without a threatening amount of competition. The restaurants used for analysis had all the information about them gathered through FourSquare and some calculations made above. 

                 <br>
                 <br>
                The final component of such a decision, choosing the exact place in the neighborhood to open a restaurant, should be made entirely by the stakeholders or aspiring restaurant business owners.
