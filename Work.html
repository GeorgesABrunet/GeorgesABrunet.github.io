										</header>
										<p>
											As of June 2021, I have been working as a generalist developer at Bolder Games. My duties
											have included and include working as a software engineer for its third party contracts and clients, programming 
											upcoming titles and prototypes, remastering previous titles for resubmission to various platforms, developing 
											plugin content for various game engine marketplaces, standardizing codebases for previous, present, and future 
											projects and products, developing and designing in-house code libraries, game mechanics, and systemization 
											protocols. At Bolder Games, the title of Lead is on a per-project basis and I have had the pleasure of leading 
											development on projects as well as worked with the leadership of other talented developers. Some of the contracts 
											the company works on are currently still under NDA, but I look forward to sharing the work I've done on them 
											once I can!
										</p>
										<p>
											As of December 2021, with the releases of the company's three remastered titles, I now work in the prototype development 
											cycle that iterates each month. During these cycles we really target "finding the fun" given a few ideas and mechanics as a 
											mold for the potential of the project. I hope that some of these will make it out of the woods so I can show all of you the 
											wonderful titles the studio is conjuring! If you would like to know more about the work accomplished in these, please refer to 
											the Bolder Games prototype page in my portfolio.

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/Starballs.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Starballs was released for a handful of platforms in 2015. The impressive game had its own custom systems such as UI, physics, and more. 
											My duties for this game definitely exceeded the other titles' complexity, as I not only changed its systemization logic to release it for the 
											Nintendo Switch, but also rewrote core game logic to bring it to an optimized standard shared across all the company's titles. I designed its' 
											persistent data handling and platform management and rewrote its UI systems, physics systems, rendering pipeline, and added quality of life 
											features to ensure the best experience possible for our players. The game is currently on track to release in January 2022 for the Nintendo Switch, 
											and its re-release for all other platforms is estimated to come shortly after. Since I finished the initial release effort for this title in November 
											2021, I will be contributing to the titles' update and patching cycle periodically after its official release on Switch.

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/SpunkSplat2.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
										
										<p>
											The first project I worked on at Bolder Games was the title "The Adventures of Spunk Dodgers & Splat". The title 
											had already been released for various platforms and the goal of my tasks on this project was to release the game on 
											Switch, and consequently re-release it for all of our target platforms. I designed and implemented the titles' 
											persistent data handling, automatic platform management, new UI interaction logic, and optimized the games' codebase to ensure 
											compatibility across a wider array of hardware supporting platforms. Spunk & Splat was released for the Nintendo Switch in 
											October 2021.

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/Roboshark2.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The second game title I worked on at Bolder Games was Roboshark Rampage. With the same needs as the previous title, I implemented 
											its new persistent data handling system and automatic platform management. I rewrote a good chunk of the game's logic to optimize it 
											for all of our target platforms. This covered enemy AI, weapons logic, UI functionality, data handling, rebalancing the game design and 
											player UX. Roboshark Rampage has been released for the Switch store as of December 2021.

										</header>
										<p>
											From June 2018 to June 2019, I had the pleasure of working as a Data Science Intern at OctaneX
												Technologies, formerly known as Standard Alcohol at the time.  As a Data Science Intern, 
												I performed various tasks such as software engineering, database architecture and management, 
												product analysis and development, data analytics, and reports generation.
											</p>
											<h3 style= "text-align: center;"> OctaneX Optimizer </h3>
											<p>
											The first project I worked on at OctaneX Technologies was the OctaneX Optimizer. 
											I was given the task of designing, developing, and coding the software with the creative 
											guidance of my supervisors. This consisted of creating an easy-to-use and visually appealing 
											tool with the purpose of optimizing fuel blends under the desired specifics of 38 constraints 
											given a selection of over a hundred molecules through linear and non-linear programming. This 
											involved a combination of complex mathematics implemented through code and to quickly learn 
											previously unfamiliar programming environments. 
											<br>
											<br>
											The OctaneX Optimizer has since been awarded a copyright by the U.S. Copyright Office, 
											and a registered trademark by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
											<br>
											<br>
											Upon completing the software my new role in this project evolved to implementing 
											an automatic analytic reports generator in the software and to maintain the updates 
											of the OctaneX Optimizer. These reports would provide in-depth information on the blends 
											concocted by the software such as logistics facilitation, actionable insights on product 
											development, and serve as quality control to present potential improvements in calculations.

										</header>
										<p>From September 2016 to March 2018, I worked as a tutor at the Department of French and 
											Italian at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I provided services to students of all levels, 
											ranging from beginner levels to Master’s levels. As a French native who learned a few other 
											languages growing up, I have a good sense of what commonalities in certain languages pose problems 
											to speakers of languages with different grammatical structures. This motivated me to design level 
											assessments for my students to measure their capabilities in French by topics and pinpoint the 
											areas of improvement that aligned with the areas they wanted to improve. I also provided 
											revisions to students’ papers and assisted them in developing their own voice in French in the 
											form of writing.

										</header>
										<p>As a Data Analytics Intern at AGV, my role included database creation and management, 
											product design and development, and data analytics. I was tasked with developing and 
											implementing an environment for real-time data uptake from market data sources in the energy 
											and specialty chemicals sector that would perform different analyses. This project merged SQL 
											organization and Python package methodologies to create an easy-to-use database that used SQL 
											queries to navigate, and Python package methods to provide visualizations, regression analysis, 
											inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and forecasting on data that it would append 
											in real-time. The goal of this project was to faciliate screening and analyzing market data as 
											part of a due diligence process for a private equity fund.
