											<h2>OctaneX Technologies</h2>
											<p>formerly known as Standard Alcohol, Inc.</p>
											<h3>Data Science Intern</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											From June 2018 to June 2019, I had the pleasure of working as a Data Science Intern at OctaneX
												Technologies, formerly known as Standard Alcohol at the time.  As a Data Science Intern, 
												I performed various tasks such as software engineering, database architecture and management, 
												product analysis and development, data analytics, and reports generation.
											</p>
											<h3> OctaneX Optimizer </h3>
											<p>
											The first project I worked on at OctaneX Technologies was the OctaneX Optimizer. 
											I was given the task of designing, developing, and coding the software with the creative 
											guidance of my supervisors. This consisted of creating an easy-to-use and visually appealing 
											tool with the purpose of optimizing fuel blends under the desired specifics of 38 constraints 
											given a selection of over a hundred molecules through linear and non-linear programming. This 
											involved a combination of complex mathematics implemented through code and to quickly learn 
											previously unfamiliar programming environments. 
											<br>
											<br>
											The OctaneX Optimizer has since been awarded a copyright by the U.S. Copyright Office, 
											and a registered trademark by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
											<br>
											<br>
											Upon completing the software my new role in this project evolved to implementing 
											an automatic analytic reports generator in the software and to maintain the updates 
											of the OctaneX Optimizer. These reports would provide in-depth information on the blends 
											concocted by the software such as logistics facilitation, actionable insights on product 
											development, and serve as quality control to present potential improvements in calculations.

											<h2>CU Boulder Department of French and Italian</h2>
											<h3>French Tutor</h3>
										</header>
										<p>From September 2016 to March 2018, I worked as a tutor at the Department of French and 
											Italian at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I provided services to students of all levels, 
											ranging from beginner levels to Master’s levels. As a French native who learned a few other 
											languages growing up, I have a good sense of what commonalities in certain languages pose problems 
											to speakers of languages with different grammatical structures. This motivated me to design level 
											assessments for my students to measure their capabilities in French by topics and pinpoint the 
											areas of improvement that aligned with the areas they wanted to improve. I also provided 
											revisions to students’ papers and assisted them in developing their own voice in French in the 
											form of writing.

											<h3>Data Analytics Intern</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As a Data Analytics Intern at AGV, my role included database creation and management, 
											product design and development, and data analytics. I was tasked with developing and 
											implementing an environment for real-time data uptake from market data sources in the energy 
											and specialty chemicals sector that would perform different analyses. This project merged SQL 
											organization and Python package methodologies to create an easy-to-use database that used SQL 
											queries to navigate, and Python package methods to provide visualizations, regression analysis, 
											inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and forecasting on data that it would append 
											in real-time. The goal of this project was to faciliate screening and analyzing market data as 
											part of a due diligence process for a private equity fund.
