											<h2>Multi Layer Colored Fog</h2>
											<p>Layers of Fog to enhance the artistic direction of your projects</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Post-process effects are crucial for any game. On one hand, they can be distinctly useful to portray the mood of the game you are trying to build, 
											and on the other hand, they can be used to improve performance with a minor tradeoff by ramping up the effects of LODs, distance-based material quality, 
											culling distance, and more! They are often used in AAA titles such as the Resident Evil franchise, and today offers new ways to add life to this effect with the popular introduction 
											of volumetric effects, with raymarching capabilities. This tutorial will hold how to implement fog as a post process effect, and how to layer different colors 
											within it as distance-based bands. 
										</p>
										<h3>
											Step 1: Basic Setup
										</h3>
										<p>
											To setup this effect, simply have a post process volume in your level. We will add the post process material to it once it is ready.
											Then, create a material and set its Material Domain to Post Process. You can set its shading model to Unlit or Default Lit, this depends on the nature of 
											your project. Name this material something relevant to its purpose and design, like "PP_ColoredFog". Organization is nice. Then head down to Blendable Location in 
											the details panel and set it to Before Tonemapping to remove visual artifacts. Since we will be reusing functionality for 
											each layer of the fog, we will create a material function to make this setup quicker, and allow easy editing. Name it "MF_FogLayers". Or something.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Step 2: The Material Function
										</h3>
										<p>
											In this material function, we will setup the essential needs of each layer. We start by grabbing the SceneTexture's post process input 0 and mask its RGB values. We then 
											use that as input A of a Lerp. This is because this will use whatever effect, or lack of effect, is present in the other space as a reference to interpolate between the fog layer 
											and itself. Next, create a function input and name it fog color. Set the input type to Vector 4, and use a component mask for its RGB values, and another for its Alpha value. Plug the 
											RGB mask into input B of the Lerp, and plug the Alpha mask into a Multiply node. Create a function input called Alpha Scalar, which really just drives the value of opacity of the fog layer, 
											and pull the result of the multiply node into the Alpha input of the Lerp. Set its input type to Scalar. Then, pull the result of the Lerp to the function output node. Go ahead and name it Fog Output.

											The other half of the material function is the distance we want the fog to start appearing. We don't need to address where it stops, as you can set that up at the end, and other fog layers will 
											automatically begin after the original layer, if you so choose. So below the first chunk of nodes, create a Scene Depth node, plug it into the input A of a Divide node, saturate the result, and plug that into 
											a function output node that you should name Distance Alpha. Create a function input node with the input type set to Scalar and name it Distance. Plug that into input B of the divide node. 
											
											There! The material Function is ready. This will serve as the bulk of logic for each layer.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Step 3: The Fog Material
										</h3>
										<p>
											We will now use the material function to set up these layers neatly. Grab a Scene Texture node with the Id set to PostProcessInput0 and once again mask its RGB values. Slap that 
											into the input A of a lerp node. Next, pull the material function into the material and connect the Fog Output to B, and the Distance Alpha to the Alpha of the Lerp. Create a Vector4 by holding 
											4 and left-clicking. Convert that to a parameter by right-clicking on it and selecting the option, and name it Color 1. Pull the RGB output of the color and create an append node. Use the alpha of the Color 1
											 to plug into the input B of that append node. Use this as the Fog Color of your first layer and set its Alpha value to 1. Create two Scalar parameter values by holding S and left-clicking and name them 
											 Alpha Color 1, and Distance Color 1. Plug them in their respective spots in the material function. To test, set the Alpha Color 1 to 0.5, and the Distance Color 1 to 6000. From now on, you can create and add new layers by copying 
											 that exact same logic and plugging it to the same input B and Alpha of another lerp, with the previous fog layer in input A. Just make sure to name the next parameters with appropriate names to differ from the previous ones.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Step 4: Implementing Bands
										</h3>
										<p>
											With the right amount of layers to your liking, we will now implement the bands to make the fog layers' transitions smoother or rougher. So grab the last lerp node of your fog layers and 
											create a multiply node. We will use a ceil node to cast whatever result to the upper rounded integer, and then use a divide node to cast it back to its original span. Create a scalar parameter value 
											named "Bands" and set the value to something arbitrary. I used 200 for smoother banding. You could plug this into the emissive color input of the post process material and call it a day, but if you have other 
											fog related effects, you may want to control how many channels the fog uses to make it compatible with all your other effects. In the project I implemented this in, I use other fog parameters that require 4 channels to work, 
											so I need this fog to also use 4 channels. So I masked each RGB channel output on their own and plugged them into a Make Float 4 node, with a constant value of 1 plugged into the alpha. This completes the Band portion.
										</p>

										<h3>
											Step 5: Limiting Sky Effect
										</h3>
										<p>
											This effect spans as a sphere around the location of the camera. This means it'll envelop everything around it. In the case you do not want the fog to affect your sky, just use the following logic. You'll need 
											to decide what is the appropriate distance falloff for your fog effect to match the limits of your sky. Any value lower than the distances of your fog layers will invert the effect over the difference in distance between 
											the falloff and your layers. Any value greater than your fog layers but lower than your sky's theshold will contain the effect to between the two. A value greater than your sky's theshold will simply remove the fog effect in 
											cosmic distances, like past your clouds. Just grab the result of the Bands to plug into the A < B component of your If Statement. From here you can plug in the 
											result into the emissive color of the material. Save the effect and create a material instance and assign it to your level's post process volume to change the values of your parameters on the fly.
										</p>

										<p>
											There you have it, Custom multi-layered colored fog. This effect is cheap and can be utilized in enhancing performance by reduction of demand of other effects. It's great, looks great, and feels great!
										</p>
