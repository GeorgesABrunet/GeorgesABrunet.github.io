											<h2>Twisted Loop</h2>
											<p>Big Brain Game Jam 2.0: Spooky Jam Edition</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											This 3 day game jam posed the usual challenges, with the addition of new ones! This was also the first 
											ranked Game Jam I participated in independently. It was rather small in participation, with only seven 
											submissions among the 30 something people that joined this game jam. Some people entered as groups, others as 
											solo. The theme for the jam was to be Halloween oriented, or "spooky", so I created assets to match!
											I wanted to use the knowledge that I gained in Unity with 2D rendering pipelines in unison 
											with 3d objects. I wanted to test out the interactions of 3D objects with 2D objects. I also wanted to experiment
											with shaders as I had only used them in a very light capacity at that point.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Inspiration</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I did not want to create a huge game given the time constraint, but was keen on achieving the 3D to 2D 
											interactions mentioned above. One minigame that came to mind was the pole dodging minigame in Kung Fu Chaos. Super fun game, by the way. 
											 In that game, the player must dodge a spinning pole as it speeds up with time. I decided to remake this concept
											 with 2D sprites as characters, and a 3D spinning pole.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>How its made</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I used the universal rendering pipeline to combine the environments for both. I used GIMP to make the sprites, 
											using the shape of the player in Oubliettes to speed up the process, and background as well as the bases the 
											players are located. I then used Blender to make the pole. I cast a shader on the background to give the effect 
											of lava and implement the atmosphere and visual themes I love to place in my games. I scripted the pole to move 
											independently and attached 3D colliders onto the AI characters to trigger animations based on chance. I also added 
											a rate of failure on the AI, so that they would not simply dodge or reflect the pole every time. As for the player 
											character, I added a smaller collider to allow for some freedom as the pole spun faster. 
										</p>
										<p>
											As the time constraint was short, there are a plethora of implementations I did not have time to make, and had 
											to compromise for simplicity to complete the game. I wanted to create a sort of fade effect from shaders on the player 
											and AI characters when they were struck by the pole and landed onto the lava, but I could not make the effect I desired 
											in time so I made the AI shoot out of range of the pole when struck, and then relocated them to their respective base 
											after a certain amount of time. I implemented the same thing for the player character, but experienced some strange behavior.
											I wanted to add some sound and visual effects to the experience, such as the pole spinning, hitting characters, music, the 
											characters expressing shouts of pain when struck, their fading into lava, as well as camera shakes when a character was struck 
											by the pole. Unfortunately, I could not implement these in the 72 hour period given. 
											I was able to squash out the main bugs in time for submission, but there is still room for improvement! Realistically I probably
											 won't fix this game but I'd love to take this idea up a notch.
										</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											After voting, my game received 2nd place, and ranked 1st for visuals, theme, and tied for fun. There are still some bugs
											to squash, so I received 3rd place for bug freeness.
											As this game did not have any sounds, I did receive the lowest grade and ranking for that specific criteria. But had I scored just
											half a point out of five in that area, I would've received first place! So lesson learned, always do a little more. You can see the 
											repository on Github <a href="https://github.com/GeorgesABrunet/Twisted-Loop/tree/master/BigBrainGameJam">here</a>.
