							<h3>GD50 Assignments</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							HarvardX's Computer Science for Game Development course, also known as GD50, offers 11 assignments and a final project
							to experiment and learn the intricate environment that is game development. The assignments have incrementing difficulties
							and each explore different aspects of game programming. The first 8 assignments explore 2D aspects and use Love2D as a platform
							and Lua as a scripting language. The last three use the Unity engine and C# to script. I have posted all 11 assignments 
							here, and am providing the code to these on Github below! The final project was also submitted to a Game Jam, so you may 
							find it there, under Great Harvest Game Jam!

												<h3>Assignment 0: Pong</h3>
											</header>
											<p> The first assignment with the goal to familiarize with Lua and Love2D. Pong is a very old
												game yet it is still played today. Instructions were to implement an AI paddle for player 1, 2, or both!

												<h3>Assignment 1: Flappy Bird</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Flappy Bird is a game that hit the mobile scene almost a decade ago, and is still popular to this day.
												Instructions were to influence pipe generation, reward the player with a medal for their performance along
												with score, and to implement a pause feature.
											</p>

											<header>
												<h3>Assignment 2: Breakout</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Instructions were to add a powerup to the game to spawn 2 extra balls upon collision with powerup, to grow
												and shrink the paddle when the player gains enough points or loses a life, and to add a locked brick that will
												only open when the player collects a powerup that acts as a key to unlock this brick.

												<h3>Assignment 3: Match-3</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Instructions were to implement a timer extension by 1 second for each tile upon scoring a match, creating 
												and adding shiny versions of blocks that would destroy an entire row or column upon match, to ensure that 
												level 1 starts just with simple flat blocks and increase variety per level, and to allow swapping only when 
												it results in a match, resetting the grid if there are no available matches.

												<h3>Assignment 4: Super Mario Bros</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Super Mario Bros is one of the greats, still being remastered and explored today! Instructions were to
												improve the player spawning so the player always spawns above solid ground, to generate a random colored
												key and block that when the player collides with the key and then the block, trigger the block to disappear
												and make a flag spawn at the end of the level. Upon collision with the flag, the player would progress to the
												next level and retain his or her score.

												<h3>Assignment 5: Legend of Zelda</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Legend of Zelda is another infamous game. Instructions were to implement hearts that drop from enemies at 
												random and heal the player upon collision, to add pots to the game world that the player is then able to throw at 
												enemies when picked up, and using animations to reflect all those actions. The pots should also break then disappear
												upon collision with enemies or walls or when traveling more than 4 tiles. This was the hardest assignment in my opinion.

												<h3>Assignment 6: Angry Birds</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Angry Birds is a huge franchise with a movie. Or movies? I don't know. Instructions were to implement functionalities 
												such that when the player presses the space bar after they've launched an Alien (and it hasn't hit anything yet), the 
												alien will then split into three separate aliens that all behave like the base Alien.

												<h3>Assignment 7: Pokemon</h3>
											</header>
											<p> By far the most exciting assignment for me since Pokemon is the first game I ever played, this assignment let me finally
												see behind the works how the early versions of the game worked. The instructions were to implement a menu that appears during 
												the player's pokemon's level up state that shows, for each stat, 'X + Y = Z', where X is the starting stat, Y is the increase, 
												and Z is the result. The math here is obviously simple but the logic of value storage and updating through states is a pretty
												exciting concept!

												<h3>Assignment 8: 3D Helicopter Game</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Based on that one game we all know from Miniclip if you were born between 1990 and 2000, this assignment was the first where
												we used the Unity engine! This was especially exciting as I'd been keen on using it for a long time. The instructions were to
												implement gems to the game that spawn pretty much the same way as coins, though more rarely and award more points on collision.
												We were also to fix the bug whereby the scroll speed of assets does not reset when the game is restarted via the space bar.

												<h3>Assignment 9: Dreadhalls</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Based on a VR game that is a mix of exploration and the horror genre, assignment 9 explored 3d space with 3d graphics. 
												The instructions were to spawn holes in a procedurally generated maze that the player can fall through. When the player 
												falls through these holes, a Game Over scene was to appear and bring the player back to the title. We were also to add a 
												text label to keep track of which maze/level the player is in and increment it by 1 upon level completion and resetting it
												upon game over.

												<h3>Assignment 10: Portal</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Portal is a magical game made by Valve that uses portals to solve puzzles. The goal of the last assignment before the final
												project was to create a map for the level using a Unity package called ProBuilder and ProGrids, ensure that the level has an
												FPSController to navigate with in the scene, and ensure that there is an object or region with a trigger at the very end that 
												will trigger the end of the level, notably a display of "You won!" on the screen with a Text object.
