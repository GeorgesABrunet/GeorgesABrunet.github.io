											<h2>Bolder Games Released Titles</h2>
											<p>A collection of the company's released titles</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Bolder Games has a wonderful portfolio of games. In a recent effort to revitalize the studio's game output, Bolder Games is initiating monthly cycles 
											of development for prototypes preceeded by the re-release of its older titles on many more platforms. On this page, I have the pleasure of showing the 
											released titles I've assisted in development.

											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/Starballs.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												Starballs was released for a handful of platforms in 2015. The impressive game had its own custom systems such as UI, physics, and more. 
												My duties for this game definitely exceeded the other titles' complexity, as I not only changed its systemization logic to release it for the 
												Nintendo Switch, but also rewrote core game logic to bring it to an optimized standard shared across all the company's titles. I designed its' 
												persistent data handling and platform management and rewrote its UI systems, physics systems, rendering pipeline, and added quality of life 
												features to ensure the best experience possible for our players. The game is currently on track to release in January 2022 for the Nintendo Switch, 
												and its re-release for all other platforms is estimated to come shortly after. Since I finished the initial release effort for this title in November 
												2021, I will be contributing to the titles' update and patching cycle periodically after its official release on Switch.

											<h3 style= "text-align: center;"> The Adventures of Spunk Dodgers & Splat </h3>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/SpunkSplat2.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
											
											<p>
												The first project I worked on at Bolder Games was the title "The Adventures of Spunk Dodgers & Splat". The title 
												had already been released for various platforms and the goal of my tasks on this project was to release the game on 
												Switch, and consequently re-release it for all of our target platforms. I designed and implemented the titles' 
												persistent data handling, automatic platform management, new UI interaction logic, and optimized the games' codebase to ensure 
												compatibility across a wider array of hardware supporting platforms. Spunk & Splat was released for the Nintendo Switch in 
												October 2021.

											<h3 style= "text-align: center;"> Roboshark Rampage </h3>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/WorkPics/Roboshark2.png" style = "width: 35%; padding-top: 8%; margin:auto;" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												The second game title I worked on at Bolder Games was Roboshark Rampage. With the same needs as the previous title, I implemented 
												its new persistent data handling system and automatic platform management. I rewrote a good chunk of the game's logic to optimize it 
												for all of our target platforms. This covered enemy AI, weapons logic, UI functionality, data handling, rebalancing the game design and 
												player UX. Roboshark Rampage has been released for the Switch store as of December 2021.
